Now, instructors can easily choose whether they would like to teach a course which emphasizes database application development or a course that emphasizes database systems issues. New overview chapters at the beginning of parts make it possible to skip other chapters in the part if you don't want the detail.\r\n\r\nMore applications and examples have been added throughout the book, including SQL and Oracle examples.
